# Abstract 
In this paper, robot swarms based on three-valued model and distributed decision-making has been investigated.
There are two algorithm to help robot swarms reach the consensus and make the decision.
Compare to "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance" the random network with evidence algorithm can decrease converence time as 200% 
and more robust to reach the consensus.
It is believed to be use at the field as blockchain, cloud services and swarm intelligence.
